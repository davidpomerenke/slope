1) The files "drag.js", "index.js", "sgVis.js" are only used in SG study

2) The file "multi-brushes.js" is a slightly altered version that I found here (http://bl.ocks.org/bollwyvl/8463137) to visualized the datasets by PCP which allows multiple brushes. 

3) The file "pcVis.js" is to find out how the data points are labeled and generate a corresponding CSV file. The CSV file was mainly meant for another methodology which we discussed at the beginning of the thesis. 

4) The  file "formWizard.js" specifies how the pages should appear and which properties each page should have

5) The file "config.js" stores the order of tasks for each participant.
